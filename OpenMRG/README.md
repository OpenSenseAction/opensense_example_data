# OpenMRG

## 5-minute data with a duration of 2.5 hours

This data was copied from the `mergeplg` example data, where it can later be deleted,
and the files have been renamed to reflect the fact that all data was aggregated
to a 5-minute temporal resolution. The notebook that was used to produce the files
was also just copied. It was not run again.
